#+TITLE: Deliberate Practice System
#+AUTHOR: Marcos Valério
#+DATE: 2026-02-10

* Overview

A Doom Emacs configuration built around *org-mode* and *org-roam* for deliberate
practice and knowledge work. The system grows incrementally -- only what gets
used gets built.

Current capabilities:
- Write and organize notes in org-mode with a clean, readable theme
- Build a personal knowledge base with org-roam (zettelkasten)
- Capture thoughts and tasks quickly into an inbox
- Keep a daily journal through org-roam dailies
- Encrypt sensitive entries with org-crypt
- Sync everything to Google Drive via rclone

* File Layout

#+begin_example
~/.config/doom/
  config.el               Loads the 5 modules
  init.el                 Doom module selection
  packages.el             Extra packages (currently empty)

  literate/               Edit these (auto-tangle on save)
    99-local.org
    00-system.org
    10-thinking.org
    11-snippets.org
    90-controls.org

  lisp/                   Generated -- do not edit
  snippets/               YASnippet templates (org, sh, lua headers)
#+end_example

* Org Directory

#+begin_example
~/ssd/documents/org/
  inbox.org               Capture destination
  roam/                   Org-roam notes
    daily/                Daily journal entries
#+end_example

Synced to Google Drive (=mvx12google:org=) with =SPC o s=.

* Encryption

Entries tagged =:crypt:= are encrypted on save using symmetric (password-based)
encryption. Auto-save is disabled to prevent leaking plaintext.

Decrypt with =SPC n d= on an encrypted entry.

* Growing the System

This configuration is intentionally minimal. New capabilities are added only
when a real daily need appears, one small piece at a time.
